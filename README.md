# Account Service

Service to create bank accounts.


## Events interface

On the Erlang node this service runs on, there is a `gen_server`
process in the local registry called `account_feed`.  This serves
events in the following format:

```
{event, Index, Type, Content}
```

- `Index` is a non-negative integer, by which events are ordered in
  time
- `Type` is either `new_account_event` or `new_person_event`
- `Content` depends on `Type`

If `Type` is `new_person_event`, `Content` is a tuple 

```
{PersonId, GivenName, Surname}
```

Where `PersonId` is a unique integer, `GivenName` and `Surname` are
binaries encoding the name components.


If `Type` is `new_account_event`, `Content` is a tuple 

```
{AccountNumber, PersonId, InitialBalance}
```

where `AccountNumber` is a unique integer, `PersonId` refers to a
`new_person_event` event, and `InitialBalance` is a number denoting
the initial account balance in â‚¬.

These events are served from the `account_feed` process via a call
like so:

```
gen_server:call(account_feed, {events, From})
```

This returns a list of all available event tuples starting with the
`From` index, in ascending order.  (Or the the least index higher than
`From` - specifying 0 here fetches *all* events.)

## Build

```
$ rebar3 compile
```

## Run locally using rebar shell

The service can be run locally including a REPL using

```
$ rebar3 shell
```

The web-frontend is served at http://localhost:8000/accounts


## Run locally using docker

This project comes with a docker container. It is built using 

```
docker build . -t accounts
```

in the root directory of the project. To run the docker container call
 
 ```
 docker run -p 8000:8000 -e "RELX_REPLACE_OS_VARS=true" -e "NODE_NAME=any_name" accounts
 ```
 
 Running with docker we are able to configure the node name of the erlang node
 using the `NODE_NAME` env var. To do so, relx must be informed that the 
 vm.args file contains env vars via `RELX_REPLACE_OS_VARS`.
 
 If the docker container is up and running, the web-frontend can be found at
 http://localhost:8000/accounts


## Testing

rebar3 & eunit are used for testing. To test the service use

```
rebar3 eunit
```

To test it within the docker container use

```
docker run accounts test
```


## Release

A release can be built using 

```
rebar3 release
```
